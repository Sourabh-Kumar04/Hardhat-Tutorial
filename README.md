# Hardhat-Tutorial 

## Pre-requisites:

  ### Installation:
  ```
  npm
  Node JS (version >=18.0)
  ```

  Create a new directory:
  ```
  sudo mkdir deployContracts
  cd deployContracts
  ```
  Setup the project using (make sure that you have write permissions the folder where the packages are installed, use this command: `sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/lib/node_modules`) 
  [eacces permission error solved](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)
  ```
  npm init
  ```
  Install hardhat & hardhat-in this new directory (use `-g` for global) using:
  ```
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
  ```
  ```
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

  ### Initialize a new hardhat env:
  ```
  npx hardhat init
  ```

## Compile & Test:
Navigate to the folder where your contracts are stored and run:
```
npx hardhat compile
```

For testing, go to the test DIRECTORY:
```
npx hardhat test
```

## Deploy:

Navigate to the project's main directory & run, here we'll use hardhat's ignition:
Note: we can also deploy to some Web3 remote network like Infura, by sending some SepoliaEther.
```
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

## Deploy locally using a custom made deploy.js script:

Install {ethers} JS:
```
npm install --save ethers
```
Next up, create a frontend directory to interact with your contract:
```
$ mkdir frontend
$ cd frontend
$ npx create-react-app Lock
```
Make a deploy.js script:
```
$ mkdir scripts && cd scripts
$ touch deploy.js
$ vim deploy.js
```
Fill the contents of `deploy.js` that are provided [here](https://github.com/lakshya-chopra/hardhat-dapp/blob/main/scripts/deploy.js)
This will allow your frontend app to access the contract's ABIs, the runtime bytecode & metadata.
This is how they look like:

Launch a hardhat node server:
```
npx hardhat node
```
This starts a new JSON RPC server at `http://127.0.0.1:8545`.

In a new dev terminal, run the deploy.js script:
```
$ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Next, we will link this with our MetaMask wallet (create one by installing it's chrome extension) & create a frontend UI to create interactive content, i.e. we'll link to this smart contract.

## create frontend directory:
```
$ cd frontend
$ npx create-react-app dapp
$ yarn install ethers

```
Here, we'll link our contract artifacts to the App.js file
```
